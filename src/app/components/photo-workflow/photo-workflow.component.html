            <p class="paragraph">Along with my partner at isiphotos.com, we created a solution to provide
                professional-level, edited photographs to clients on an as-live basis during events. The process was first
                put to the test at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brasil, and after
                a successful run, we partnered with Facebook and Instagram to create an “Insta-booth” for live events. We
                ran the Insta-booth style photo shoots at the ESPN X-Games, MLB All-Star Game, the US Women’s National Team,
                and USOC athlete processing
                for the 2016 Rio Games.</p>

                <h2>The Task</h2>
                <p>It is no secret the demand for real-time content has grown considerably, almost becoming a requirement
                    for modern brands, especially in the sports world. We wanted to provide U.S. Soccer fans high quality,
                    live images directly from the
                    field during the team’s games at the FIFA World Cup, allowing them a distinct view through social media
                    only available on U.S. Soccer platforms to supplement television viewing.<br></p>
                <p>Similarly, the athletes themselves need to provide quality imagery to fans as their personal brands and
                    social identities grow. With an adapted approach from the live on-field shoots, we created a photobooth
                    type workflow to provide athletes
                    and events stylized images that they could distribute on their own platforms.</p>

                <h2>The Challenges</h2>
                <p>Speed. </p>
                <p>After engaging with fans and social media staff, it became apparent that speed was a key factor is
                    determining content's reach and interactivity - with the qualifier that fans did not expect the quality
                    of the images to drop. Upon further
                    examination of metrics for best performing social content, we did notice a "first to publish" type of
                    pattern that confirmed posts with high quality imagery performed better than posts with no images or
                    posts that were not among the
                    first to announce major events, but had quality imagery.</p>
                <p>Therefore, how could we make this process as fast as possible without sacrificing quality?</p>
                <p>Giving fans a curated photo gallery after a game had been done before - we wanted to provide the same
                    quality images in real time.</p>
                <p>When working with athletes or singular clients, our challenge was to provide highly stylized images of
                    exceptional quality that they could use directly after sitting for the photos. We wanted them to walk
                    out of the studio space with images
                    ready to be distributed via social or any web platform.</p>

                <h2>The Solutions</h2>
                <p>Using network enabled cameras, we were able to come up with a solution that allowed the photographer to
                    push photos to an FTP server.<br></p>
                <p>On field at the FIFA World Cup, all photographers were allocated an ethernet cable at their assigned
                    station around the pitch. We then utilized cloud storage platform Box.com’s ability to set up a
                    directory as an FTP destination. Once
                    configured, the photographer could set his/her camera to push selected photos to Box folder.&nbsp;<br>
                </p>
                <p>The “cloud FTP” folder allowed an editor anywhere in the world to access the Box account and watch the
                    folder as the photos transferred in. The social media team at U.S. Soccer headquarters in Chicago was
                    able to monitor the photos in
                    real time as the photographer pushed images from the field at the stadiums in Brasil. The average time
                    from the photographer pressing the shutter to a photo appearing on Twitter/Facebook was about 8 minutes.
                    In exceptional cases such
                    as a goal, an expedited image could be pushed to social media in just more than 5 minutes.<br></p>
                <p>In a studio environment, a similar setup was employed, with the main difference that the camera was
                    directly tethered to a computer with a watch folder configured as an FTP destination. Using a
                    combination of photo editing software and
                    proprietary RAW presets, the editor could ingest and edit 5-10 photos of the subject, and upload them to
                    a cloud sharing platform within 3-6 minutes. The address of the private, personalized location of the
                    files was then shared with
                    the athlete, their agent, or event staff.</p>
